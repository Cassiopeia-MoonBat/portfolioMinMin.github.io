Hi, my name is Mina Luna Cassiopeia /　みな or short just Moon. 
This here is going to become a portfolio of all my work, starting from 2025 with creation made during my time at the Hochschule Furtwangen University in the course: "Games and immersive media".
This site is currently in Test building so no work from me is currently posted here.
